  <h1>KELLYELLIS CS</h1>
  <p>I'm Kelly Ellis, and I am a programmer, a hula dancer, and a bitter ex-clarinetist.</p>
  <p>I am currently a student at UCLA, where I enjoy walking up hills to get to class and crying over my homework.  These last few years since I first came to college and entered the world of computer science have been productive, tortuous, and incredibly fun.</p>

  <p>Hula in the morning, hula walking down the stairs, hula all the way to class, hula sitting on the couch, hula alone in the elevator, hula waiting for food in the microwave, hula when no one's watching, hula when everyone's watching.</p>
